# Angular Phone Catalog Hybrid

This is a Hybrid Angular 1.7 / 6 Application based on https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial
Demo: http://angular.github.io/angular-phonecat/step-14/app/#!/phones

There are several versions:
0.1 - Angular 6 Shell / AngularJS phonecat application bootstrapped inside
0.2 - Angular 6 Shell + Phone service / Rest of application in AngularJS
0.3 - Angular 6 Shell + Phone service + Phone List component + Phone Details component + Router / Rest of application in AngularJS

In each scenario, you can find the original AngularJS src files co-existing with the Angular files (appended with '-2'), but only the Angular files are being used.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
